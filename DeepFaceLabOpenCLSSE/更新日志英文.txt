OpenCL build: fixed, now works on most video cards again.

old SAE model will not work with this update.
Fixed bug when SAE can be collapsed during a time

Added option
Use CA weights? (y/n, ?:help skip: n ) :
Initialize network with 'Convolution Aware' weights. 
This may help to achieve a higher accuracy model, but consumes time at first run.

Extractor:
removed DLIB extractor
greatly increased accuracy of landmarks extraction, especially with S3FD detector, but speed of 2nd pass now slower.
From this point on, it is recommended to use only the S3FD detector.

Converter: added new option to choose type of mask for full-face models.

Mask mode: (1) learned, (2) dst, (3) FAN-prd, (4) FAN-dst (?) help. Default - 1 : 
Learned – Learned mask, if you choose option 'Learn mask' in model. The contours are fairly smooth, but can be wobbly.
Dst – raw mask from dst face, wobbly contours.
FAN-prd – mask from pretrained FAN model from predicted face. Very smooth not shaky countours.
FAN-dst – mask from pretrained FAN model from dst face. Very smooth not shaky countours.
Advantages of FAN mask: you can get a not wobbly shaky without learning it by model.
Disadvantage of FAN mask: may produce artifacts on the contours if the face is obstructed.

SAE: added new option

Optimizer mode? ( 1,2,3 ?:help skip:1) : 
this option only for NVIDIA cards. Optimizer mode of neural network.
1 - default.
2 - allows you to train x2 bigger network, uses a lot of RAM.
3 - allows you to train x3 bigger network, uses huge amount of RAM and 30% slower.

Epoch term renamed to iteration term.

added showing timestamp in string of training in console

== 03.11.2019 ==

CUDA10.1AVX users - update your video drivers from geforce.com site

face extractor:

added new extractor S3FD - more precise, produces less false-positive faces, accelerated by AMD/IntelHD GPU (while MT is not)

speed of 1st pass with DLIB significantly increased

decreased amount of false-positive faces for all extractors

manual extractor: added 'h' button to hide the help information

fix DFL conflict with system python installation

removed unwanted tensorflow info from console log

updated manual_ru

== 03.07.2019 ==

fixes

upgrade to python 3.6.8

Reorganized structure of DFL folder. Removed unnecessary files and other trash.

Current available builds now:

DeepFaceLabCUDA9.2SSE - for NVIDIA cards up to GTX10x0 series and any 64-bit CPU
DeepFaceLabCUDA10.1AVX - for NVIDIA cards up to RTX and CPU with AVX instructions support
DeepFaceLabOpenCLSSE - for AMD/IntelHD cards and any 64-bit CPU
